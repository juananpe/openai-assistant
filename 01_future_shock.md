Video 01 - Future Shock

Future shock is an idea created and popularized by Mr. Alvin Toffler. Alvin Toffler was an American writer and journalist who in 1971 published this book, Future Shock. Interestingly, it was first published as an essay in the prestigious Playboy magazine (allegedly), but that's another topic. Future Shock presents an idea.

To explain this idea, I asked ChatGPT to explain this concept of future shock as if to a 13-year-old child, following a bit Richard Feynman's idea of trying to explain things in the simplest way possible.

ChatGPT's response:

Imagine you're playing a really fast video game, where things change all the time, so fast you can barely keep up. Well, "future shock" is kind of like that, but in real life. It's an idea that says sometimes things in the world change so fast that people feel confused or overwhelmed, like they can't keep up with all the new technologies, fashions or ways of living.

It's like when they release a new phone every year and just when you're getting used to yours, there's a newer one and everyone's talking about it. Some people get excited about all those rapid changes, but others may feel like they're being left behind. The term was invented by a guy named Alvin Toffler in a book he wrote many years ago, and we still use it to talk about how we feel when everything around us moves too fast.

Alvin Toffler proposed that as we move forward in time, things change faster than we can handle. The speed of these changes can be so intense that some people feel stressed, confused and even scared. The concept of "future shock" is a warning about how we must adapt and learn to manage changes in society and technology in order to enjoy the benefits without feeling overwhelmed or fearful.

As a thought experiment in a course I teach at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), I reflected on the life of my grandmother, who was born in 1917 in a very different Spain, where sheep were sacrificed in the center of cities, there were no motor vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages, radio did not exist and the telephone was just being introduced. However, before she passed away in 2014, my grandmother had been able to make a color video call in real time with her great-granddaughter in Uruguay, more than 6,000 miles away, using a smartphone, a device that she herself knew how to operate.

This is future shock: during one person's lifetime, the world can change completely. And as change accelerates, these radical changes occur more frequently in society. If we consider the change in my grandmother's life to be significant, we can only imagine the change we are experiencing ourselves.

Recently, I experienced a clear example of how technology continues to advance: it was yesterday when the Plus subscription was activated on my Chat GPT account, which is paid, and with it access to plugins. These plugins are essentially a way to allow Chat GPT's language model to invoke external services to obtain updated information. In other words, instead of being limited to what it learned up until 2021, it now has the ability to access information online. There is even the possibility for users to program their own plugins so the system can access specific information they provide. In particular, I have focused on exploring the Wolfram plugin.

Wolfram Alpha, created by Stephen Wolfram and his team, is a very different kind of search engine than what we usually use. Stephen Wolfram, recognized for developing influential programs like Mathematica and for his contributions to engineering-oriented programming languages, has equipped Wolfram Alpha with a vast amount of data and computational tools spanning chemistry, physics, statistics, and more.

Recently, I challenged ChatGPT: prepare a demonstration that would show the Wolfram plugin's ability to solve engineering problems. Despite the rushed instructions riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, ChatGPT offered an example: a vehicle suspension damping problem, a topic that, although not my specialty, caught my interest.

ChatGPT outlined a hypothetical scenario, assigned parameters and variable values, and then suggested how the Wolfram Alpha program could be used to solve this problem. It was even possible to request the solution directly from Wolfram Alpha through ChatGPT, which not only processed the function, but also provided a graph and the corresponding JSON query.

The ability to access a graphical representation of the solution and explanations on how to interpret it is undoubtedly impressive. However, a critical question arises: How do you know if the graph is correct if it's not your area of expertise? Herein lies both the challenge and the opportunity.

I could easily mislead a teacher or be misled by the results, but I could also use this tool to learn and experiment, for example, by adjusting the suspension on a buggy I build with my kids. If the vehicle works properly, the data validates itself; otherwise, it becomes questionable.

This represents a clear disruption and a "future shock" that we as educators must face. For the participants in this course, I invite you to share in the forum your experiences with Wolfram Alpha and your opinions on this example. We will continue exploring these issues in upcoming videos.
